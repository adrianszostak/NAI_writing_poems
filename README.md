Building LSTM model using PyTorch to writing poems.

Input:
506 unique poems
Output:
A poem written by a program that has learned to write poems from more than 500 poems

The input data and the n_epochs parameter have the greatest impact on the quality of the row. 
The larger the n_epochs, however, the slower the program compilation

Examples for n_epochs = 5 and for n_epochs = 10, respectively:
